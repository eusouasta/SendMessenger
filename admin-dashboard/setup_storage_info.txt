// We need SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to create buckets programmatically without RLS blocks usually
// But I don't have it. I only have what's in the environment or client.

// Actually, I can use the standard client if RLS allows bucket creation (usually false).
// Let's TRY. If not, I can instruct the user.
// BETTER: Use 'mcp_supabase-mcp-server_execute_sql' to insert into storage.buckets directly?

// Script is backup. I will try SQL first.
